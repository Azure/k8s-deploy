
# Deploy manifests action for Kubernetes

This action can be used to deploy manifests to Kubernetes clusters.

This action requires that the cluster context be set earlier in the workflow by using either the [Azure/aks-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/aks-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action or the [Azure/k8s-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action.

If you are looking to automate your workflows to deploy to [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/) and [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/), consider using [`Azure/webapps-deploy`](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy) action.

## Action capabilities

Following are the key capabilities of this action:

- **Artifact substitution**: The deploy action takes as input a list of container images which can be specified along with their tags or digests. The same is substituted into the non-templatized version of manifest files before applying to the cluster to ensure that the right version of the image is pulled by the cluster nodes.

- **Object stability checks**: Rollout status is checked for the Kubernetes objects deployed. This is done to incorporate stability checks while computing the action status as success/failure.

- **Secret handling**: The secret names specified as inputs in the action are used to augment the input manifest files with imagePullSecrets values before deploying to the cluster. Also, checkout the [Azure/k8s-create-secret](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-create-secret) action for creation of generic or docker-registry secrets in the cluster.

- **Deployment strategy** The action supports canary and blue-green deployment strategies:
	 - **Canary strategy**: Choosing canary strategy with this action leads to creation of workloads suffixed with '-baseline' and '-canary'. There are two methods of traffic splitting supported in the action:
	    - **Service Mesh Interface**: Service Mesh Interface abstraction allows for plug-and-play configuration with service mesh providers such as Linkerd and Istio. Meanwhile, this action takes away the hard work of mapping SMI's TrafficSplit objects to the stable, baseline and canary services during the lifecycle of the deployment strategy. Service mesh based canary deployments using this action are more accurate as service mesh providers enable granular percentage traffic split (via service registry and sidecar containers injected into pods alongside application containers).
	    - **Only Kubernetes (no service mesh)**: In the absence of service mesh, while it may not be possible to achieve exact percentage split at the request level, it is still possible to perform canary deployments by deploying -baseline and -canary workload variants next to the stable variant. The service routes requests to pods of all three workload variants as the selector-label constraints are met (KubernetesManifest will honor these when creating -baseline and -canary variants). This achieves the intended effect of routing only a portion of total requests to the canary.
	- **Blue-Green strategy**: Choosing blue-green strategy with this action leads to creation of workloads suffixed with '-green'. There are three route-methods supported in the action:

      *Terminolgy: An **identified** service is one that is supplied as part of the input manifest(s) and targets a workload in the supplied manifest(s).
	    - **Service route-method**: **Identified** services are configured to target the green deployments.
	    - **Ingress route-method**: Along with deployments, new services are created with '-green' suffix (for **identified** services), and the ingresses are in turn updated to target the new services.
	    - **SMI route-method**: A new [TrafficSplit](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha3/traffic-split.md) object is created for each **identified** service. The TrafficSplit object is updated to target the new deployments. **Note** that this works only if SMI is set up in the cluster.
	    
      Traffic is routed to the new workloads only after the time provided as `version-switch-buffer` input has passed. `promote` action creates workloads and services with new configurations but without any suffix. `reject` action routes traffic back to the old workloads and deletes the '-green' workloads.

## End to end workflows

Following are a few examples of not just this action, but how this action could be used along with other container and k8s related actions for building images and deploying objects onto k8s clusters:

### Build container image and deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

```yaml

    # Set the target AKS cluster.
    - uses: Azure/aks-set-context@v1
      with:
        creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
        cluster-name: contoso
        resource-group: contoso-rg
        
    - uses: Azure/k8s-create-secret@v1

        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret

    - uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v1.4

          manifests/service.yml
        images: |
          demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        imagepullsecrets: |
          demo-k8s-secret
```

### Build container image and deploy to any Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    
    - uses: Azure/docker-login@v1
      with:
        login-server: contoso.azurecr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
    
    - run: |
        docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
      
    - uses: Azure/k8s-set-context@v1
      with:
        kubeconfig: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}
        
    - uses: Azure/k8s-create-secret@v1
      with:
        container-registry-url: contoso.azurecr.io
        container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret

    - uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v1.4
      with:
        manifests: |
          manifests/deployment.yml
          manifests/service.yml
        images: |
          demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        imagepullsecrets: |
          demo-k8s-secret
```
## Sample workflows for new traceability fields support 

 - Environment variable `HELM_CHART_PATHS` is a list of helmchart files expected by k8s-deploy - it will be populated automatically if you are using `k8s-bake` to generate the manifests.
 - Use script to build image and add `dockerfile-path` label to it. 
   The value expected is the link to the dockerfile : `https://github.com/${{github.repo}}/blob/${{github.sha}}/Dockerfile`
   If your dockerfile is in the same repo and branch where the workflow is run, it can be a relative path and it will be converted to a link for traceability.
 - Run docker login action for each image registry - in case image build and image deploy are 2 distinct jobs in the same or separate workflows.
